BMI Calculator Advanced (IF/ELSE)
Previously, we've created a function that is able to calculate the BMI. But once we get a result, we will want to tell the user what the number means.

Write a function that outputs (returns) a different message depending on the BMI.


BMI <18.5, the output should be: "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are underweight."
BMI 18.5-24.9, the output should be "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you have a normal weight."
BMI >24.9, the output should be "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are overweight."

The message MUST be returned as an output from your function. You should NOT NEED to use alert, prompt or console.log in this challenge.
